# VirtualConcierge

My husband and I run an Airbnb out of our home. Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book 
unique accommodations around the world â€” online or from a mobile phone or tablet.
The idea of a Virtual cocierge came to me when I was compiling an information
booklet for each guestroom. After many text messages of "Where is "this"?" or "How does "this" work?",
I decided to create a personal kiosk app that would work on a tablet for each guest room. 

This Virtual Concierge provides all the information a guest may need to know for their stay. 
It includes:
* Information about myself and my husband, the house, and our pets. 
* A "Restaurant" section that integrates the YELP API to show local food options.  
* A "Games" section that lists all the board games we own via the Board Game Geek API.
* A "Guestbook" that shows reviews from previous visiors and saves new reviews to the database.  
* Contct information 

Things that I would love to implement in V2.0 includes:
* Contact us (our phones) directly from app.  

Yelp: 
* Ability to search all businesses around town. 
* Paging

Board Games:
* Ability to click interested board gamess to provide general info about that game.
* Provide general overview on how to play.

Guestbook:
* Validate City  
* Abilty to edit review.
