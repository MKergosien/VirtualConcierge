# VirtualConcierge

My husband and I run an Airbnb out of our home. 
(Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book 
unique accommodations around the world â€” online or from a mobile phone or tablet.)
The idea of a Virtual cocierge came to me when I was poorly putting together a information
booklet for each guestroom. After many text messages of "Where is "this"?" or "How does "this" work?",
I decided to create a personal kiosk app that would work on a tablet for each guest room. 

This Virtual Concierge provides all the information a guest needs to know for their stay. 
It includes:
*Information about us, the house, and our pets. 
*A "Around Town" section that integrates the YELP API 
*A "Games" section that lists all the board games we own via the Board Game Geek API
*A "Guestbook" that saves reviews to a database. 


Things that I would love to implement in V2.0 includes:
*A deeper dive into the Yelp API for better searching. 
*Make the board games clickable - provide general info about the game and instructions on how tp play.
